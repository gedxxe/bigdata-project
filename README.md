# bigdata-project
This repository includes the needed resources for the "BIG DATA AND INFORMATION RETRIEVAL (2023205162) / (301)" course.

In this session, we will practice the combination of Decision Tree Classifier and k-Nearest Neural Network (kNN) for finding the correlation between dataset attributes based on given dataset obtained from Kaggle.

# Notes
- This rep is still under development and in the experimental stage.
- Future improvements will be made to satisfy the project practice results.
