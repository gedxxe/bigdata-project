# bigdata-project
This repository includes the needed resources for the "BIG DATA AND INFORMATION RETRIEVAL (2023205162) / (301)" course.

In this session, we will practice the combination of Decision Tree Classifier and k-Nearest Neural Network (kNN) for finding the correlation between dataset attributes based on given dataset obtained from Kaggle.

# Summary:
1. The dataset used is a smarthome dataset that contains information on power consumption and environmental sensor reports.
2. Two different algorithms, Decision Tree and kNN, were used to predict trends.
3. The Decision Tree algorithm performed poorly with an accuracy of around 0.4 compared to kNN, which achieved an accuracy of 0.78.

# Notes
- This rep is still under development and in the experimental stage.
- Future improvements will be made to satisfy the project practice results.
